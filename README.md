##code1:lastword_length
###discription
This Python script takes a string input from the user, splits it into words using whitespace as the separator, and calculates the length of the last word in the input string. Finally, it prints the length of the last word.
###Example:
Suppose you execute the code and input the string "Hello world, how are you". The script will output 3 because the last word in the string ("you") contains three characters.

##code2:count_ones
###discription
This Python script counts the occurrences of the digit '1' within a range of numbers from 0 up to a specified integer (n) provided by the user. It achieves this by iterating through each number in the range, converting them into strings, and counting the occurrences of the digit '1'.
###example:
Suppose you execute the code and input the number 13. The script will count the occurrences of '1' in numbers from 0 to 13:
The digit '1' appears in the numbers: 1, 10, 11, 12, 13.
The script will output 6, as there are a total of eight occurrences of the digit '1' in the range from 0 to 13.

##code3:majority_element_finder
###discription
This Python code contains a function, majority_elements(nums), which finds elements in an array that occur more than a third of the total number of elements. It uses the Counter class from the collections module to count how many times each element appears in the input array. Then, it identifies and returns the elements that occur more frequently than this threshold.
###example:
Suppose you run the code and input the array elements 1,2,2,3,2,1,1,3. The script will identify elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times in this array:
In this case, the elements 1 and 2 both appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.so the output will be [1,2]

##code4:pascal_triangulat_generator
###discription
The Pascal's triangle is a triangular pattern of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.
The algorithm works as follows to print 5 rows of Pascal's triangle:
We initialize an empty list called triangle to store the rows.
Use a for loop from 0 to numRows-1. So when numRows=5, it loops from 0 to 4.
For each iteration, initialize a new row with just 1s. Number of 1s is equal to row number + 1.
1st row has 1 element: [1]
2nd row has 2 elements: [1, 1] and so on
For 2nd row onwards, we need to replace some 1s with the sum of numbers above them.
We loop from 1 to i and update each element as: row[j] = triangle[i-1][j-1] + triangle[i-1][j]
Here triangle[i-1] represents the previous row
Add each newly created row to triangle list
Finally return the triangle list containing numRows pascal rows.
###Example for 5 rows:
Initial triangle = [],
1st row = [1]
2nd row = [1, 1]
3rd row = [1, 2, 1]  (2 = 1 + 1)
4th row = [1, 3, 3, 1] (3 = 1 + 2)
5th row = [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
